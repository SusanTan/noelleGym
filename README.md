# NOELLE artifact evaluation

This repository includes the evaluation materials for the NOELLE CGO 2022 paper: "NOELLE Offers Empowering LLVM Extensions".

## Artifact

This artifact includes the evaluation of the data that supports the version of the paper that was submitted in September.
Next you can find the instructions to reproduce the related results.

Since NOELLE is an ongoing project, we did not stop working on it after submission.
We improved NOELLE after submission to the point that we can now target more benchmarks and we can perform more evaluations.
This artifact also includes the capability to generate these extra evaluations and benchmarks.
Finally, these new evaluations and benchmarks will be included in the final version of the paper.

### Prerequisites 

The artifact is available as a docker image.

The docker image includes the following software:
- go (we use 1.13.7)
- LLVM (with clang) 9.0.0
- cmake 3
- awk
- sed
- bash


## Data collection
In this section, we will collect the data required to reproduce the figures in the paper.

### Run all evaluations (Estimated time: ? hours)

To run the artifact to generate all data needed to support the submitted version of the paper, run within the docker image
```
cd ~ ;
./run_me_submission.sh ;
```

To (optionally) run the artifact to generate all data needed to support the final version of the paper, run within the docker image
```
cd ~ ;
./run_me_final.sh ;
```
